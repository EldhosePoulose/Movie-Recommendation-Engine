# Movie-Recommendation-Engine
In this repository we build Na√Øve Bayes Algorithm using several datasets.
Goal: Recommendation Engine (Movie, Book etc...)
The datasets: 
1. A sample dataset
2. Movie Rating Dateset, Collected by GroupLens Research Group from MovieLens website.
3. Goodreads (self prepared metadata)
4. IMDB (self prepared metadata)


To acknowledge use of the dataset in this project, I would like to cite the following paper:
